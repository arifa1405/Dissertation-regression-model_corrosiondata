# # Machine Learning and Neural Network–Based Corrosion Analysis



## Quick Start

Open the notebook below in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially:

NOTEBOOK/corrosion_v2.ipynb

All data preprocessing, model training, validation, and evaluation are performed inside the notebook.
```

---

## Repository Structure

DATA/ → synthetic corrosion dataset

NOTEBOOK/corrosion_v1.ipynb → initial regression-based analysis

NOTEBOOK/corrosion_v2.ipynb → updated machine learning / neural network workflow

REQUIREMENTS.txt → Python dependencies

README.md → project documentation

---

## Outputs

Exploratory data analysis and feature inspection

Feature preprocessing and standardization

Train / validation / test dataset splits

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model training

Training and validation performance evaluation

Test-set performance assessment and generalization analysis

---

## Future Work

-Add more corrosion-related variables (features) for deeper analysis
