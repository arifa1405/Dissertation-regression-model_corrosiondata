# Corrosion Data Analysis using Regression Models

This project is part of my dissertation work. It analyzes **time-series corrosion data** using regression models to highlight the science behind corrosion and understand key factors influencing it.

## Quick Start

```bash
# (Optional) create & activate a virtual environment
# then install dependencies manually:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# Run the analysis script
python NOTEBOOK/corrosion.py
```

---

## Repository Structure

- `DATA/` → corrosion dataset (synthetic time series)  
- `NOTEBOOK/corrosion.py` → main analysis script  
- `README.md` → project documentation  

---

## Outputs

- Correlation heatmaps of features  
- Regression coefficients & intercept  
- R² score to evaluate model performance  
- Diagnostic plots for model evaluation  

---

## Future Work

- Build dashboard for visualization (in progress)  
-Add more corrosion-related variables (features) for deeper analysis
